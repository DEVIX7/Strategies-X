## Why did you make Strategies X?

I started to use AutoStrat after it got released in 2022. It provides an automatic process so the user won't have to touch the keyboard and mouse. But the ugly section color of Wally UI V2 makes the main ui look very bad to me. In the first attempt, I use some tricks to make the ui source link change into my own UI. And it was success, at least I think so. I recognized it didn't work in obfuscated strat. And due to some annoying bugs in that time, I decide to make my own version based on its source in September 2022. I also added many features, fixed bugs, and make it more stable.

Although I considered as a hobby project, I spent a lot of time making this project works. Also, It took me more than 6 months to release this project due to the loss of motivation or studying to prepare for university. With lots **(IF NOT ALL)** things that have been changed, added, or remade compared to the original one, I decided to rename this project to **"Strategies X"**.

## Goals

* Support Multiplayers.
* Have better tools for strat maker.
* Faster and more stable.

## FAQ
I got a bug, where do I report it?
* You can report it in [Issues](https://github.com/Sigmanic/Strategies-X/issues).

Can I get banned when using this script?
* I will make sure that the detection will be low as possible, so you won't get banned.

Can I use this with premium strat?

Can you make the premium strat be free or cracked?
* No, and never. This script is **OPEN-SOURCED** meaning any cracking stuff **DO NOT ALLOWED** in here.
