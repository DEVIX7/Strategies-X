## Why did you make AutoStratModded?

I started to use AutoStrat after it got released in 2022. It provides an automatic process so the user won't have to touch the keyboard and mouse. The ugly section color of Wally UI V2 makes the main ui look very bad for me. In the first attempt, I use some trick to make the ui source link change into my own ui. And it was success, at least I think so. I recognized it didn't work in obfuscated strat. So I decide to make my own version based on its source. I also added many features, fixed bugs and make it more stable.

## Goals
* Support all current strats (even premium strats).
* Support Multiplayers.
* Have better tools for strat maker.
* Faster and more stable.

## Requirements
Executors Supported:
* Synapse X V2
* Script-Ware
* Fluxus
* Krnl

Or any executors that supported the following librarys:
* Filesystem Functions
* Console Functions
* Websocket Library
* Crypt Library

## Features (WIP)

## FAQ
I got a bug, where do I report it?
* You can report it in [Issues](https://github.com/Sigmanic/AutoStratModded/issues).

Can I get banned when using this script?
* I will make sure that the detection will be low as possible, so you won't get banned.

Can I use this with premium strat?
* Maybe.

Can you make the premium strat be free or cracked?
* No, and never. Even though this script is open-sourced, that's not the goal of this script. Also, the premium strat is the hard work of very talented people, who spend lots of time making it, should be paid for their work.
